# To Do List

The Odin Project - To create a to do list using Javascript (no framework), HTML and CSS

## Learning Points
- Make functions more concise - should aim to do only one thing per function
    - Seperate object creation from creation of HTML elements
        - Will make code cleaner and more readable
        - Currently have to refactor code/do work arounds to make this project work
        - Perhaps create object first then have a function that will generate required HTML elements using object details
        - When updating elements maybe update object first and re-create updated HTML elements from there

- To have better grouping of area of concerns for JS files

- MutationObserver useful to monitor changes in text with content editable set to true

- Plan CSS styling better to avoid repeating self

- Better naming conventions / more uniform naming convention to prevent confusion
